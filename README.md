For long I have been wanting to make games
I had tried several engines in the market but I've not been successful 

I later understood that my basic weakness was my lack of programming skills to make a complete product. 

So I decided to use plain javascript to build something of my own..
This repository has code i piked up from various sources, because it is not for commercial use or even 10% close to alpha stage, I'm not crediting, because my idea is to ultimately rewrite the whole thing once I get a deep understanding of how it works.

the ultimate idea is to make a game frameworks that supports a mobile editor that helps anyone make interactive 2D and 3D content anywhere and anyhow they want. Ultimately, I believe that all developemnt will be made on mobile for mobile.

Keeping that in mind, I should say that I'm very far off.

I hope I'm successful in what I want to make.
